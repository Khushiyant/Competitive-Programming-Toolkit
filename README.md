It is required setup toolkit for competitive programming.

## Access

Use git clone to copy folder in desired location.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khushiyant/Competitive-Programming-Toolkit.git
```

## Usage

cp ./template.cpp ./path_to_required_file.cpp
```
## Features
Repository contains the following:
* **template.cpp**
* **input.in**
* **output.out**

Content included in _**template.cpp**_:
1. Macros for:
   * _faster I/O_
   * loops
   * print debugging
   * vector operations
2. Predefined Fuctions for:
   * swapping - _**Datatype insensitive**_
   * Optimised _nCr_
   * _Binary to Decimal conversion_ and vice-versa
   * Predined **ONLINE_JUDGE**
3. Miscellaneous:
   * setup for testcases I/O
   * Useful values macros 

## Under Development Updates
* ### Inclusion of operations on graphs, trees.
* ### CP Cheetsheet for problems on basic Greedy algo., Game Theory, and many more
* ### Set Theory function easy implementation
